Convert::IBM390p -- functions for manipulating mainframe data

Convert::IBM390p is a Perl module.  It supplies various functions that
you may find useful when messing with IBM System/3[679]0 data.  See the
POD documentation in the module, or "man IBM390p" after you have
installed it.

How to Install
==============

The usual:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

One More Note
=============

*** IF YOU CAN USE IBM390 RATHER THAN IBM390p, YOU SHOULD. ***

This module is a Perl-only version of Convert::IBM390.  IBM390 is
written in a combination of Perl and C; in my testing, the IBM390
versions of pdi, pdo, and fcs_xlate ran 5-6 times as fast as the pure
Perl versions.  If, however, you have trouble compiling or installing
IBM390, you can use this module instead.  I might even be able to
address your installation concerns some day! :-)
